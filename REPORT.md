<h1>Challenge Report</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>
    Fairly new to VUE, all of the endeavors below are entirely new to me at least in this challenge. 
    please pardon me for any shortcomings that may arise later on.<br/>
    <br/>
    Started with identifying major functionalities based on the design to map the layout of my app,
    coming from the top then going down to the bottom.<br/>
    <br/>
    After placing core elements, proceeded to create their accompanied functions,
    begining with the search bar. chose to use a plugin called v-calendar as i had experience using it with my 
    previous app and it does the job well.<br/>
    <br/>
    Used moments.js for converting date/time values outputed by the v-calendar plugin.
    Producing the correct results with the start and end dates, displaying different date formats based on time differences,
    and formatting table results came without much problems.<br/>
    <br/>
    On the otherhand I had a bit of an issue with sorting results though, especially with dynamic sorting. but with effort through
    both searching for solutions and tinkering around i finally managed to get it to work. Also extended the sorting feature 
    a bit further, adding a reverse sort, and the output text for mail results count as it would make sense to do so.
    <br/>
    After that hurdle, i moved to adding minor details that is on Mission 1, like displaying results, placing reply counters, clip icons 
    and sort indicators. proper placement for the minor details in mobile took a bit of time due to precision placements.<br/>
    <br/>
    For Mission 2, I had gmail as referrence, with the search input still present and usable above.
    Using it will replace the current view with a repopulated table based on the search query.
    As per the rule, i had only used the resources given, particularly the icons. 
    though i had to modify a few to meet some designs, like with the previous/back, reply and forward buttons.
    All in all i had fun with the challenge as it allowed me to gain new knowledge in the process, especially
    when handling result sets.
